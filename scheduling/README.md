```
Node-affinity is a property of PODS that attracts them to a set of NODES (either as a preference or a hard requirement). 

Taints are the opposite -- they allow a NODE to repel a set of PODS. 

Tolerations are applied to PODS. Tolerations allow the scheduler to schedule PODS with matching taints.
